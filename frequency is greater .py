# Given a List, extract all elements whose frequency is greater than K.
# Input: test_list = [4, 6, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 8], K = 3
# Output: [4, 3]
# Explanation: Both elements occur 4 times.
# Input: test_list = [4, 6, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 6, 6], K = 2
# Output: [4, 3, 6]
# Explanation: Occur 4, 3, and 3 times respectively.
